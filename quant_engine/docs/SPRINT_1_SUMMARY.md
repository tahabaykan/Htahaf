### 2. Event Contracts
- ✅ **app/event_driven/contracts/events.py** - All event types defined:
  - BaseEvent (with idempotency)
  - L1Event, PrintEvent, FeatureEvent, AlertEvent
  - PositionEvent, ExposureEvent, SessionEvent
  - OrderEvent, IntentEvent
- ✅ JSON serialization/deserialization
- ✅ Redis Stream format conversion

### 3. State Management
- ✅ **app/event_driven/state/store.py** - Redis Hash wrapper for latest state
- ✅ **app/event_driven/state/event_log.py** - Redis Stream wrapper with consumer groups

### 4. Workers (Event Producers)
- ✅ **app/event_driven/workers/exposure_worker.py**
  - Publishes exposure snapshots every 15s
  - Mock position data (Sprint 1)
  - Calculates gross/net exposure, buckets
  
- ✅ **app/event_driven/workers/session_worker.py**
  - Publishes session clock every 1s
  - Tracks market regime (OPEN/EARLY/MID/LATE/CLOSE)
  - Calculates minutes-to-close

### 5. Decision Engine (Brain)
- ✅ **app/event_driven/decision_engine/engine.py**
  - Consumes ev.exposure and ev.session
  - Maintains latest state in Redis Hashes
  - Loads risk rules from YAML
  - Generates de-risk intents (SOFT_DERISK, HARD_DERISK)
  - Simple strategy: reduce largest position (Sprint 1)

### 6. Execution Service
- ✅ **app/event_driven/execution/service.py**
  - Consumes ev.intents
  - STUB MODE: Logs actions, doesn't execute real orders
  - Simulates order fills (Sprint 1)
  - Publishes ev.orders events

### 7. Risk Rules Configuration
- ✅ **app/config/risk_rules.yaml**
  - Gross exposure limits (HARD CAP 130%, soft 120%)
  - Bucket configuration (LT, MM_PURE)
  - Time regime definitions
  - De-risk playbook (SOFT_DERISK at 16:15, HARD_DERISK at 16:28)
  - Stale data gates

### 8. Worker Entry Points
- ✅ **workers/run_exposure_worker.py**
- ✅ **workers/run_session_worker.py**
- ✅ **workers/run_decision_engine.py**
- ✅ **workers/run_execution_service.py**

### 9. Infrastructure
- ✅ **docker-compose.yml** - Redis service (already existed, verified)
- ✅ All dependencies in requirements.txt (redis, pyyaml, etc.)

## 📊 Event Flow (Sprint 1)

```
Exposure Worker (15s) → ev.exposure → Decision Engine
Session Worker (1s)   → ev.session  → Decision Engine
                                              ↓
                                    ev.intents → Execution Service
                                                      ↓
                                              ev.orders (stub)
```

## 🔧 How to Run

1. **Start Redis:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d redis
   ```

2. **Start Workers (4 separate terminals):**
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1
   python workers/run_exposure_worker.py
   
   # Terminal 2
   python workers/run_session_worker.py
   
   # Terminal 3
   python workers/run_decision_engine.py
   
   # Terminal 4
   python workers/run_execution_service.py
   ```

3. **Monitor Events:**
   ```bash
   redis-cli XREAD COUNT 10 STREAMS ev.exposure 0
   redis-cli XREAD COUNT 10 STREAMS ev.intents 0
   redis-cli HGETALL state:exposure
   ```

## 🎯 Key Features

1. **Event-Driven Architecture**
   - All communication via Redis Streams (NOT PubSub)
   - Durable, replayable events
   - Consumer groups for reliable processing

2. **Idempotency**
   - All events have idempotency keys
   - Operations are idempotent

3. **State Management**
   - Latest state in Redis Hashes
   - Event log in Redis Streams

4. **Risk Management**
   - Gross exposure limits (HARD CAP 130%)
   - Time-based regimes
   - De-risk playbook

5. **Separation of Concerns**
   - Workers produce events
   - Decision Engine consumes and decides
   - Execution Service is ONLY broker interface

## 📝 Sprint 1 Limitations

- **Mock Data**: Exposure Worker uses mock positions
- **Stub Execution**: Execution Service logs but doesn't execute
- **Simple Derisk**: Basic strategy (reduce largest position)
- **No Real Broker**: IBKR integration stubbed
- **No GRPAN**: Prints/features computation stubbed
- **No Market Data**: L1/prints/features workers not implemented

## 🚀 Next Steps (Sprint 2)

1. **Real Broker Execution**
   - IBKR adapter in Execution Service
   - Real order placement/cancellation/replacement
   - Fill callbacks → ev.orders

2. **Open Orders Tracking**
   - Track in Redis
   - Potential exposure calculation

3. **Market Data Ingestion**
   - Hammer/IBKR feed → ev.l1
   - Trade prints → ev.prints
   - GRPAN features → ev.features

4. **Enhanced Derisk**
   - Truth tick proximity for SOFT_DERISK
   - Dominant print zones
   - Chunked reduction (10% per step)

5. **Alerts System**
   - Alerts worker → ev.alerts
